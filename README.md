# String Interpolation

### A c++ library for string interpolation for samples see the [test/src/example.cpp](test/src/example.cpp)
 
> Requirements : C++23, Cmake

## build 
```
cmake -B ./build -S .
cmake --build ./build

or

mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ..
cmake --build .

```

### All library "files for compiler and linker" will be built on ./lib folder. To include library in use ```#include <string_interpolation.h>``` 
and also you can copy the ```string_interpolation.h``` file in your project, and use it like header only without build library
